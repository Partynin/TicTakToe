#Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
As you may have discovered yourself, tic-tac-toe is terminally dull.
But the mathematicians play a more sophisticated version.
+ Each turn, you mark one of the small squares.
+ When you get three in a row on a small board, you’ve won that board.
+ To win the game, you need to win three small boards in a row.
+ You don’t get to pick which of the nine boards to play on. That’s determined by your opponent’s previous move. Whichever square he picks, that’s the board you must play in next.
